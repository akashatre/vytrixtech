        <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Vytrixtech started in Bengaluru with a simple idea: technology should not be restricted to metros. We saw shopkeepers, tutors and small businesses in Tier 2 & 3 cities struggle with basic tools. We wanted to bring them elegant, affordable tech that feels like it was made for them â€” not for giants. Our moto: <strong>Tech for Everyone, Everywhere.</strong></p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mt-3">Founded by Akash, a developer who grew up seeing local businesses rely on paper and memory, Trident.tech builds products that are practical, reliable and respectful of users' time.</p>
